#Project Quincy

###Project Quincy is an open source Django, MySQL application for tracing historical networks through time and space.

The code in this repository runs the new, beta version of _The Early American Foreign Service Database_.  The current [www.eafsd.org](http://www.eafsd.org) still runs using the older, Rails, code which can be found in the [projectquincy](https://github.com/jabauer/ProjectQuincy) repository.  The Rails code is no longer being updated and the EAFSD will soon be shifted over to the new Django code.
