#Project Quincy

###Project Quincy is an open source Django, MySQL application for tracing historical networks through time and space.

The code in this repository runs the new version of _The Early American Foreign Service Database_ [www.eafsd.org](http://www.eafsd.org). The older, Rails, version has been taken offline but the code can still be found in the [projectquincy](https://github.com/jabauer/ProjectQuincy) repository.  The Rails code is no longer being updated.
